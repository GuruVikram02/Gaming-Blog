            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

            <strong><i>Prototype 2 (stylized as [PROTOTYPE2]) is a 2012 open world action-adventure video game.
                    Developed by
                    Canadian studio Radical Entertainment and published by Activision, it is the sequel to 2009's
                    Prototype.
                    The
                    game was announced at the 2010 Spike VGA Awards.[2] Versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were
                    released on
                    July 14, 2015 alongside the first game as Prototype Biohazard Bundle. Separate versions of the games
                    became
                    available in August 2015.[3]

                    The game features a new protagonist, James Heller, as he goes on a quest to destroy the Blacklight
                    virus.
                    The
                    story is one of revenge, as Heller wants to kill Alex Mercer, protagonist of the original Prototype,
                    after
                    his
                    family was killed in the outbreak of the Blacklight virus. While the game was a top seller for a
                    period
                    of
                    time,
                    its sales would eventually result in the downsizing of its developer.</i></strong><br>

            <p>
                <strong><i>
                        One year after the events of the first game, U.S. Marine Sergeant James Heller, after returning
                        from
                        touring
                        in
                        Iraq, discovers his wife and daughter to be declared dead, causing him to rejoin the military in
                        the
                        fight
                        for
                        NYZ against the Blacklight virus. Heller is briefed on the previous outbreaks in Idaho in the
                        60's
                        and
                        in
                        NYZ in
                        the events of the first game. He later finds that Alex Mercer (the main protagonist in the first
                        game)
                        has
                        now
                        lost faith in humanity and begins chasing him.<br>

                        Pursuing Mercer for vengeance, Heller is infected by Mercer with a strain that imbues him with
                        similar
                        superhuman abilities. After blacking out, Heller awakens in a Yellow Zone lab where Gentek
                        scientist
                        Dr.
                        Anton
                        Koenig and Blackwatch Col. Douglas Rooks are experimenting on him. Heller escapes from the
                        Gentek
                        base,
                        when
                        Mercer confronts him and claims Gentek and Blackwatch are responsible for recreating and
                        cultivating
                        the
                        Blacklight virus, making them responsible for the second infection and the deaths of Heller's
                        family.
                        Revealing
                        his plans to take down Gentek and Blackwatch, Mercer offers a truce to Heller. Unsure of
                        Mercer's
                        intentions
                        Heller goes to his local pastor, Father Luis Guerra, for advice and help.

                        Using information supplied by Guerra, Heller hacks into Blacknet Terminals to find out about and
                        sabotage a
                        number of their operations.<br> Gradually consuming his way through Blackwatch, Heller
                        eventually
                        finds
                        and
                        confronts Koenig, who claims to be on his side and reveals Blackwatch's super-soldier program,
                        codenamed
                        "Orion". Heller prevents Project: Orion's progress by killing a super-soldier who was injected
                        with
                        his
                        DNA.
                        After consuming one of the head scientists,<br> Heller discovers that Koenig was observing him
                        in
                        order
                        to
                        find
                        his weaknesses. Enraged at Koenig's betrayal, Heller tracks him down, only to discover that he
                        has
                        powers
                        similar to he and Mercer, and is one of several "Evolved" agents planted in Gentek and
                        Blackwatch by
                        Mercer.
                        After defeating and consuming the doctor, Mercer reveals to Heller that he intends to recruit
                        him in
                        an
                        attempt
                        to control NYZ. His doubts growing, Guerra then shows Heller a video tape of Mercer releasing
                        the
                        virus
                        for
                        the
                        second time in Penn Station, the same place Mercer originally released and contracted the virus.

                        Enraged at Mercer's deception, Heller sets off to the Green Zone to hunt down Mercer's henchmen,
                        including
                        an
                        Evolved agent in Gentek named Sabrina Galloway; upon confronting Galloway, however, Heller
                        reluctantly
                        teams
                        up
                        with her when she reveals she can help him take down Mercer. With Galloway's help, Heller soon
                        finds
                        that
                        Mercer
                        plans to infect the entire world through "Whitelight", a contaminated vaccine released by Gentek
                        that
                        actually
                        serves to accelerate infection and evolution rather than prevent it.<br>

                        Frustrated with Heller sabotaging his plans, Mercer confronts him and the two engage in a
                        fight.<br>
                        However,
                        Mercer's strength proves superior and he easily overpowers Heller. As Mercer attempts to consume
                        Heller,
                        a
                        strange chemical reaction occurs, resulting in Mercer discovering he is unable to kill him due
                        to
                        his
                        'annoyingly resistant DNA', solidifying Heller's status as a virus-human hybrid. Mercer promptly
                        flees,
                        and
                        Heller receives a call from Father Guerra. Guerra informs him that a large horde of infected
                        have
                        amassed
                        outside his apartment.

                        Heller arrives at Guerra's apartment, finding only his corpse. However, a grieving Heller uses
                        Guerra's
                        phone to
                        reach Athena, Guerra's contact, who is revealed to be Dana Mercer. Dana explains that Heller's
                        daughter,
                        Maya,
                        is still alive, prompting Heller to head for the Red Zone to take down Mercer and save Maya.
                        After
                        Heller
                        prevents Blackwatch's second attempt to level Manhattan Island, Rooks takes Heller's daughter
                        hostage in
                        Gentek
                        Headquarter and locks it with an unbreakable door, but Heller consumes an Alpha Juggernaut and
                        temporarily
                        obtains the ability to control other Juggernauts. Using this new ability, he breaks the door.

                        Heller confronts Rooks, who reveals that he has a daughter of his own, and grants Heller free
                        passage to
                        leave
                        NYZ.<br> Before Heller can take Maya, Galloway arrives and kidnaps her, having joined forces
                        with
                        Mercer
                        once
                        more. Upon confronting Mercer, he reveals that he plans to solve international conflicts and
                        world
                        problems
                        by
                        infecting the entire human race, effectively creating a superorganism, with Maya's unique DNA
                        inherited
                        from
                        her
                        father acting as the catalyst. After Mercer absorbs Galloway and the remaining Evolved, the two
                        engage
                        in a
                        bloody duel, only for James to emerge victorious and to kill and consume Mercer, who says,
                        "Welcome
                        to
                        the
                        top
                        of the food chain", before dying.

                        Subsequently, Heller wipes out the infected in NYZ along with most of the Blacklight Virus; then
                        using
                        Mercer's
                        absorbed memories, Heller locates and frees Maya and Dana from a vault. The story then ends with
                        the
                        three
                        overlooking New York before Dana questions what to do next.</strong></i><br>
